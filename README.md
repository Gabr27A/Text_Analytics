# NBA Fan Engagement Tweets
For this case we were given several datasets (csv files) with thousands of tweets from NBA fans. Our task was to make an analysis for Nike's marketing team and make investment recommendations based on what the fans where talking about. I based my analysis on the months where the pandemic started and the NBA season was suspended. I decided to use this months to see what the fans where talking about the most even when there was no game live. 
My findings let to understand that fans like to recall big legends such as Michael Jordan, therefore Nike should focus on offering content to NBA that are related to stories and commemorations. This and other recommendations where made from an exploration with word clouds, frequency of words, and others. 
Along with the script there is the power point presentation with a narrated voice over.
